    <h1>Thursday night, after dinner in the north side with my friend, we took a cab back. Just emerging from the week’s exhaustion, I still felt like I was in a dream. The car moved along the lake, and words came and went between us. Then, suddenly, fireworks bloomed in the distance. Through the shadows of the trees, it became clear. Round, bright, and vivid. Fireworks, to me, are something that only appear when there’s warmth, a sense of belonging. But here, in a place far from home, they burst open so effortlessly, without warning—burst after burst, brilliant yet gentle. In that moment, the restless feeling inside settled. If only this ride, moving closer and closer to the fireworks, could last forever.</h1>
